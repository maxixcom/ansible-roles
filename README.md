# Playbooks

## Here be dragons

My [Ansible](https://github.com/ansible/ansible) playbooks.

As a warning, these playbooks will be in somewhat a state of flux for the next
few weeks as I migrate infrastructure codes to Ansible. :D

Follow the instructions over at [vagrant-ansible](https://github.com/ryankanno/vagrant-ansible) to play around with them!
